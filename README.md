# open-source-society
Inspired by [Vikrant Varma blog](http://www.amrav.net/2016/05/20/what-is-metakgp/) where he talks about centralizing the information and what is [Metakgp](https://wiki.metakgp.org/). The idea is to centralize the information so that everyone can benefit from it and grow together. 

**Actual quote:**
> Often, information about various things in IIT Kharagpur is hard to find, possessed by a few privileged individuals, inconsistent across different sources, or simply anecdotal and unrecorded. I hope that the wiki model will be successful in centralising important knowledge about KGP.

The idea is to play long term , you might be thinking that not sharing information will improve your chances to get that thing,*it might* , but you got to realise that you are only the result partially of the people you spend time with and if they are not growing and you are not helping them grow will in turn limit your growth.Sharing information is the best way to grow and learn. More on this later.

Site will be build and deployed on heroku in a week time. Please contribute and keep learning. All the information will be presented soon . Thank you .
